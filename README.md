## Guy Kemball-Williams

I'm an ex-founder of an on-demand delivery app (Bevy - £250K raised, 20K users, >£300k turnover) with a background in strategy, financial analysis and property development. I love hard skills and building things and want to join a company where I can make beautiful, scalable software solutions to real world problems.

## Skills

#### Strategy

I originated Bevy's business model and, when it wasn't quite working out, championed our pivot from commercial service provider to direct-to-retail sales. Back in the mists of time, I also did a brief stint at Accenture advising Shell on how to upgrade their site systems loyalty program across UK, Netherlands and Luxembourg.

#### Financial Analyis

My role at Bevy (my startup) was co-founder and CFO. As well as much of the day-to-day running of the business, I was behind the number-crunching for our financial projections, the accounts and our valuation. Prior to Bevy, I was the business analyst at a fledgling property investment fund, Hearthstone Investments.

#### Research and Data Analysis

I was responsible for the research on Bevy's potential market size and general viability (ultimately key to our £250K raised in seed funding), as well as all subsequent analysis of customer and sales data (frequency, basket size, geographic distribution, RPR, CPU etc.). While at Hearthstone, I produced all of their research notes and IFA briefings on everything from portfolio optimisation to mortgage approval rates.

#### Plumbing, Electrics, Carpentry...

Although not directly applicable to software development, this (hopefully) demonstrates versatility of thinking and a willingness to get my hands dirty. Immediately prior to founding my startup I spent 2 years renovating houses. Funds were tight and so together with YouTube and the UKGOV Building Regulations I taught myself to do the necessary skilled work. This included two new bathroom creations/installations, major roof repairs, full rewiring, new central heating and a cellar conversion.

- Saved £120K from quoted renovation costs
- Directly managed 10+ labourers and subcontractors
- Added £800K in value to completed projects
